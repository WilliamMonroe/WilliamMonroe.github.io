*********************************************** UNIFIED OPERATING SYSTEM BUILD 2.3.7 -- 10.15.2077 ***********************************************<br/></br>
Clay Lockwood was born in Vault 107 which had an experiment consisting on studying the practical implications of a long term period of eugenics in<br/>
a population. At birth new dwellers in the Vault underwent phsyical and genetic tests to start a "Life Profile" that would be built up over their<br/>
life time, providing the Vault's ZAX Mainframe with information to decide what couples may be permitted to reproduce with the goal of improving<br/>
the Gene Pool in the Vault over succeeding generations.<br/>


It's common practice in Vault 107 for babies born with physical deformities to be euthanized immedately after birth. At the age of twelve Vault<br/>
Dwellers go undergo mental examinantion and testing to identify any "deficiencies" which impact the score of their profile. Children with these<br/>
phsyical or mental conditions as well as children that were not born in a "sanctioned birth" are often called "runts" by the rest of the Vault<br/>
and face a life of shaming until their death or their exiling from the Vault. Clay was one of these such children, he was disowned by his family<br/>
and exiled from the Vault a single day before his fifteenth birthday.<br/>
